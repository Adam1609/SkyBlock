Here are some notes for Wiki creation and that stuff, you may used it, i dont care at all
***

For header use # then the text like:
#Header1
also try with ## and ### for 3 headers, idk why they did that..
##Header2
###Header3

Use * for bulleted list:
* one
* two
* four! yea four!

Use *** for a awesome line!
***

Then for making some awesome squares for Permissions like? whut? 
here an example:

> Using the Donator rank Permissions

| Permission | Command | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| donrank.ranks.nick | /donate (nick) (rank) | Donates to username and selects Rank |
| donrank.ranks.list| /donate rlist | Gives rank list |
| donrank.ranks | No Commands | 2nd Main permission |
| donrank | No Commands | Main Permission |

and all that.

use >
for quotes
> TKRT Creations

Now trying to do **BOLD** words just use ** at the end and start of a word

I think using one * will make it *Italic*

Also for **BOLD** and *Italic* at the same time use *** like ***this***

Ill add more stuff later, thats good for now, Read it as Raw.
