Here are some notes for Wiki creation and that stuff, you may used it, i dont care at all
***

for header use # then the text like:
#Header1
also try with ## and ### for 3 headers, idk why they did that..
##Header2
###Header3

Use * for bulleted list:
* one
* two
* four! yea four!

Use *** for a awesome line!

Then for making some awesome squares for Permissions like? whut?
